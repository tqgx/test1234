Based on the previous part...[About the real PortableSoftware principle] (https://tqgx.github.io/posts/2023-09-18-%E7%9C%9F%E6%AD%A3%E7%9A%84%20Portable%20%E8%BB%9F%E4%BB%B6%E8%A3%BD%E4%BD%9C%E2%80%94TurboStudio/)
I think you can clearly understand the importance of portable software.Of course, I have been a bit lazy myself, and this article will teach you how to really do TurboStudio software, ~~ from getting started to getting buried ~~
- This article will be taught using TurboStudio 19.6.1208.Need to download please go to [OpenTools] (https://github.com/tqgx/OpenTools/releases/tag/Database-All-Tools)
- find Turbo. Studio. 19.6.1208.28 v11.7 z can download, compression password has been attached to the article.So let's get started
- Make portable software for TurboStudio, virtual machine is recommended.

## This article will be taught in the fastest way:
Snapshot one, let's finish the Capture Before animation

## Parameter setting:
This step is mainly to put all the folders, registry, in a folder, if you do not do this step, your Portable software is equivalent to not doing Settings→

- See where I typed @appdir @\Data, please follow
- Change Project Type to Standalone/ISV Application (exe)
- Compress payload
- Sentence Shutdown process tree on root process exit (Files can be closed normally)
## Disable software from using the Internet:
- Go to Network→DNS,
- When you see Hostname or IP Address, type: *
- Redlirect input: 0.0.0.0

Let's move on to IP Restrictions

![|inline](https://github.com/tqgx/tqgx/blob/main/TQGX/T6.png?raw=true)
- Enter: * in Route
- Enter Deny in Type
__ Reminder: If the software wants to use the network, delete the above parameters __
## Virtual machine snapshot (complete the above steps, this can speed up the production)
The picture below uses the snapshot is Vmware 15 version, after taking the snapshot, we roll back from this place every time, because the parameters are set, it will be very convenient!!

### Install Software:
Let's install the software

![|inline](https://github.com/tqgx/tqgx/blob/main/TQGX/T2.png?raw=true)

- After installation, all parameters of the software are set in this step, or the activator, the license is lost, but all the Settings are done
- After that, we move on to the next step: Capture and Diff

### Quarantine folder:
This step is a must do in order to keep folders and registries from getting out (if you make sure none of these files get out, you can set all quarantines.)
- In any case, it is simple to see where there is a folder, which side set Write Copy, in the following figure I set are common
- Folder isolation:

### Quarantine Registry:
- All registration can be set (the reason is simple, do not delete yourself.When the registration form is not wrapped in a folder, it will run out)

### Select the open path of the software (select.exe)
- This place is for you to choose the correct opening of the software, for example, we chose.lnk, this is the path file, select.exe is the correct....

# Build finished!

- Enjoy the fruits of victory!
- Look, everything is so clean in one folder, we can check it with MasterSeeker!
