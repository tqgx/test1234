- Personally, it's a good show, about twenty-seven episodes long, and the whole story is about what happens around the main character.
- The whole story line is mainly cheerful and funny, as you can see in the picture above, taking place in the modern world, with the Internet, technology, but combined with some Taoist things.
- The most impressive thing is the organization of the play - the full nature of the villain four crazy
- On the one hand they are the villain, but on the other hand you feel that it makes sense, they are like the open source ecology that the real world wants to represent.Set the trend.Adding totality doesn't require any rules, it's easy to do.

- I was even more impressed when one of the four crazy members, the pink-haired girl, had her birthday, and they invited two guys together
- As a result, the other three people, joint writing, like a character, called Gao Ning, his ability is to play with emotions, and another person does not know, but likes to keep lending money to others (but does not need interest, as long as it does not = death).
- I think the four crazy, probably only pink hair girls are normal, there is a girl, is a psychologist, the ability to read other people's hearts, but there is a kind of unspeakable hate, speak very soft, but actually very hurtful

- As for the main character?The protagonist has been instilled with some concepts since childhood, that is, can not be strong in front of outsiders, and always have to endure.Everyone thinks that he has mastered an extraordinary skill.But it is also because of the relationship of patience, and know how to hide their own strength
So throughout the play, we can see that the main character walks the wretched genre, and most of them can take advantage of it in an easy way.Most people in the show thought it was too much

- Characters who appear in the series: the old Master, as the protagonists search for the truth, such as killing his dead grandfather's real brother.Chased him all the way here...They say that being a champion can give you the answers you want and so on

- Finally, finished watching, but the amount of information is too complicated, but in the play constantly interspersed some words, where do you want to go next?Everyone has a purpose to come here, only the way they want to look like blabla's words
- And do what you want to do, don't hold yourself back all the time, accept that a certain version of you is you.You don't have to be what others like you to be, and neither do you.
- Or in the chosen place, will ask, Do you regret?Or encounter some memory-changing problems, Coke Sprite theory: a cup filled with Coke, which is equivalent to my memory, another person's cup, equivalent to someone else's memory
- What if we put each other's Coke in our own glasses?Am I still me?
- Still, if I empty my coke and put the other guy's coke in mine, then am I me?(It will become, this person is the empty body of another person (it is you) but in fact it is already the other person)

It's a show I'd probably recommend anyway, but I'm going to bed. Good night
