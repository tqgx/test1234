The # HashMyFiles software diagram looks roughly like the one above

Need to download please go to [OpenTools] (https://github.com/tqgx/OpenTools/releases/tag/Database-All-Tools)
- Find HashMyFiles_2.43.7z to download, zip password and SHA256 are attached to the article.So let's get started
SHA-256, as mentioned above, is the value of a Hash, which has many values....For example, MD5 SHA1 SHA256/512/1024/2048, etc. There are many more that will not be listed in detail

Open the software is like this, we just throw everything on, it will be automatically converted to SHA256
- If you feel that it is not enough, it does not matter, we can through the following operation, View→Choose columns→ and then choose your own sentence, you can have a variety of Hash values
