description: 'If someone says who is the most convenient, who is the best, who is the fastest?I would naturally recommend version 1.0 of Snipaste.Whats so good about it?Simply say that after you pick the picture, you can directly grab the software frame, it will automatically help you choose, which greatly increases the speed of the picture!Not only that, it can also directly point Ctlr + C copy in the process of drawing, which is most of the drawing tools can not do, there are additional widgets at home...'
