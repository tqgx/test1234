description: '"This is something Ive wanted to talk about before, but theres a reason why we should focus most of our software on the browser.Most of us probably know at one point or another that we want to chat with our friends, we install Discord, we listen to music, we install Spotify, we test our Internet speed....Installed the Speedtest, but after the installation every day all the time forced to update, is not very tired?'

# About all software concentrated in the browser:
- All software focused on the browser is not a new concept, in fact, very popular in foreign countries, such as Discord, or WebCord, or some common large and small to call to the network, website functions, in essence is a browser.
- The advantage of the software being concentrated in the browser is that it doesn't have the highest privileges on the computer (because we don't know what is going on in the background of these software, such as Discord, Edge, Skype, Spotify, Speedtest, or some software, which is updated directly).
## Avoid operating in the background, separated from the system!
- I can control the permissions I want to open: let's say I don't want to open microphones, sounds, ads, notifications, USB ports, hardware ids, or large and small, all in the browser, but on the software?(Everything has been stolen for you, hee hee)
- You can also implement security policies with U-block Origin, Ghostery, VPN, and a whole bunch of other things
Probably is the above, I only feel that there are necessary tools, put on the computer, like the above said those zero total, we can put on the browser, really need to perform on the computer tools, we put on the computer
