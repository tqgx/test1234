Do we need to talk about the principle?It's so boring, and the reason I'm pushing Centbrowser so hard is because if a browser wants to keep everything, scale.That requires the computer's hardware unique identification ID, can be retained.Centbrowser breaks this limit...
- It just means that the author is all alone, all at once, and everyone wants the author to update.....Using this browser means "convenience", but updating or not updating is secondary (I personally think that ease of use is the most important).
# No more nonsense, the text.
- to https://www.centbrowser.com/history.html select 32 - Bit Portable, or 64 - Portable download it

- Personally, I would choose 32-Portable because some software doesn't need to 64Bit.It's a good tool if it gets the job done

## Go to CentbrowserPortable folder and click Chrome to go to the browser

Next finished!!If you want to change the computer, or backup, just take the CentbrowserPortable with you.
- I can recommend an extension that blocks ads: (truly free and open source)
