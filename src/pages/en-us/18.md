## Will download the good Xenia system file:

# Burn Fedora (when temporary system, install Xenia for use)

#### The first command type is:
python3 -m http.server -d  /run/media/liveuser/08E9-3313 
- Please change /run/media/liveuser/08E9-3313 to the file location with blue background.
 
# Xenia real installation!
- Please let's open the second command line:
- Enter: sudo wget https://gitlab.com/xenia-group/installer/-/archive/main/installer-main.zip
- Enter: sudo unzip installer-main.zip
- Enter cd installer-main

# Hard drive model: Enter: lsblk

- Install whatever your hard drive shows (type /dev/sda, of course, depending on you, otherwise the system will eventually fail to install)

## After the model is officially installed:
- Enter: sudo./main.py
- (Select hard disk format) : []: /dev/sda (My hard disk)
- enter: http://localhost:8000/root-systemd.img (Xenia system image file)
