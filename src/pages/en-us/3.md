# Do you see the picture above?The work column can be shrunk to ultra-narrow....
- need to download please go to [OpenTools] (https://github.com/tqgx/OpenTools/releases/tag/Database-All-Tools)

After opening the software, we will open windows Settings and shrink the work bar

- Next, close the work column unnecessarily, and then we will move the work column to the left
- Or push to the right and you will find that the work bar becomes extremely narrow!
# However, only open software has a way to work fission super narrow
## Open software: automatically hide to the system icon
- So here are a few small steps you can take to keep your work list super narrow forever.
- Right click, create shortcut

- Right click on the shortcut, in the last space, enter -hideWnd (This is to avoid software opening will not show, automatically to the system icon)

## Automatic start:
- Press win + r on the keyboard
- Enter shell:startup

![|inline](https://github.com/tqgx/tqgx/blob/main/TQGX/workbar5.png?raw=true)

Just pull the shortcut in
