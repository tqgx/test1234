After jekyll's destruction, I met Hugo...In the choice of the current Astro, I only feel, finally relieved, although to Astro, everyone has no way to comment, I am really happy to laugh Mimi

Part of the joy is that I finally have a blog of my own, and part of it is that sometimes I wonder if it would feel like a good thing to sacrifice my comments and change the background.(You see, this is the only place where our pictures can be fully displayed.)
Ha, ha, ha, ha. It's 10:41 at night.I finally got this blog in shape.Then I have to migrate the article. It's a hassle
