description: 'EnvyControl can freely open your graphics card, whether it is Intel internal display, or Nvidia unique display, you can switch freely, the benefit of this tool is to help the laptop, desktop computer save power, there is no complex and cumbersome Settings.But many of the systems built-in tools are already built in to save power...But it still sucked power, so I turned to the graphics card'

# Start installation: EnvyControl
- sudo emerge eselect-repository
- sudo eselect repository enable guru
- sudo emaint sync -r guru
- sudo emerge envycontrol
# On: EnvyControl
sudo envycontrol -s integrated
- When finished, just reboot.
## EnvyControl Introduction:
- There are three modes to choose from:
- Integrated: Use only the internal display, completely close the independent display, and the HDMI output hole of the laptop is invalid.
- Hybrid: uses the default display, and enables Nvidia PRIME, and can use the single display when needed.Newer Nvidia graphics cards also support RTD3 automatic power saving on demand.The HDMI output port works in this mode but is inefficient.
- Nvidia: All use Nvidia alone to increase power consumption.It is recommended to use this mode when you need to connect the HDMI output hole to the external screen.
- Because the purpose of installing this software is to turn off the Nvidia graphics card itself, I will choose Integrated

After installation: (You see, the NVS 5400M at the back of the GPU is gone)
